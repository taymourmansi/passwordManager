# Password Manager

The purpose of this application is to help you manage all your passwords in one location to allow you to create or generate passwords as complex as you want without worrying about forgetting them. 

## How It Works

The application prompts the user to enter 2 things: The website andd email. Once the user enters both, the program checks whether this website and email combination is already saved, if not then it creates an entry for it, if it exists, then it just simply updates the password. The password field is up to the user to enter a current password or have the application generate a complex password. 

## How To Run It

In order to run this application, make sure that Python3 is installed on your computer. Once installed, download the entire passwordManager folder. Run a terminal or command prompt, then change the directory to the application's directory. Once the terminal's current directory is the passwordManager, simply run the program by using python3 main.py. A window should pop up with the user interface.
